### - scripts to do screen and GPU switching on NVidia Optimus laptops with [Bumblebee](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee)

These scripts allow you to easily switch your laptop's screen from internal to external or enable both screens at once.

They've been written for a ThinkPad W530 but may work with a lot other ThinkPads or even non-Lenovo laptops with Nvidia Optimus.

### WARNING

This is work in progress! Read the scripts before running them!

They will be finished in 2018, check for new commits regularly.
A proper README with instructions on how to configure Bumblebee will be provided as well.
