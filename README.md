## bumblebee-multiscreen-tools
### - scripts to do screen and GPU switching on NVidia Optimus laptops with [Bumblebee](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee).

These scripts allow you to easily switch your laptop's screen from internal to external or enable both screens at once.
They should work with a docking station.

They've been written for a Lenovo ThinkPad W530 and the "Lenovo ThinkPad Mini Dock Plus Series 3" docking station.
Other devices are not tested but may work, these scripts are not very hardware dependent.

### WARNING

This is work in progress! Read the scripts before running them!

They will be finished in 2018, check for new commits regularly.
A proper README with instructions on how to configure Bumblebee will be provided as well.
