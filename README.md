# bumblebee-multiscreen-tools - scripts to do screen and GPU switching with [Bumblebee](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee)

These scripts allow you to easily switch your laptop's screen from internal to external or enable both screens at once.

They've been written for a ThinkPad W530 but may work with a lot other ThinkPads or even non-Lenovo laptops with Nvidia Optimus.

**NOTICE:** This is work in progress, it will be finished through 2018. A proper README with instructions on how to configure Bumblebee will be provided then as well.
