## High priority
- Update https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Hybrid-Grafikkarten/Bumblebee/ to mention bumblebee-multiscreen-tools:
  - "Multimonitorbetrieb" section says that it doesn't work, but in fact with bumblebee-multiscreen-tools it is possible

## Low priority
- Renice Xorg, perhaps helps with vsync issues
