## High priority
- Update wikis to mention bumblebee-multiscreen-tools once development is sufficiently finished (which it is not yet!):
  - https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Multi-monitor-setup
  - https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Hybrid-Grafikkarten/Bumblebee/
    - "Multimonitorbetrieb" section says that multiscreen mode doesn't work, but in fact with bumblebee-multiscreen-tools it is possible

## Low priority
- Renice Xorg, perhaps helps with vsync issues
